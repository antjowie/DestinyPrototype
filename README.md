At the moment I only want to recreate the sword mechanic (the Hive sword to be specific). 

I am to improve/learn the following:
- Setting up a 3D character with...
    - [] Clothing simulation
    - [x] Multiple animations
    - [x] Physics based movement?
    - [] IK for foot placement
    - [x] Setting up a third person camera
    - [] Jumping
- Creating the sword mechanic
    - [] Multiple types of combos
    - [] Animations
    - [] Bursts of movement
    - [] Targeting system
    - [] VFX
- Enemies
    - [] They'll just be dumb, maybe I'll add some AI to them
