At the moment I only want to recreate the sword mechanic. 

I am to improve/learn the following:
- Setting up a 3D character with...
    - Clothing simulation
    - Multiple animations
    - Physics based movement?
    - IK for foot placement
- Setting up a third person camera
- Creating the sword mechanic
    - Multiple types of combos
    - Animations
    - Bursts of movement
    - Targeting system
    - VFX
- Enemies
    - They'll just be dumb, maybe I'll add some AI to them
